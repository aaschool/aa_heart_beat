AA Heart Beat is a project about capturing the present moment of a certain space.

By tracking the appearence of user's face/wrist, this web-deployed video detection calculator will assign color to each participant showing their face, giving an indivusual color, of which will leave a track on the web canvas. Those traces will blend together by calculation through fluid-simulation, eventually becoming an interesting painting of colors blending together with gradient in bewteen.
